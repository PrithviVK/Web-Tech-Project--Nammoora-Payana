Kodlamane Shree Vishnumurthy Temple : of Serenity and Mystery,[1] is situated in a heavenly beautiful hill forest in Shree Parashurama Kshetra called Kodlamane. A beautiful stream flows next to the temple which is called Vishnu Tirtha. This temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu(or Mahavishnu is same)who is only giver of Moksha or Mukti. This is very ancient untarnished Tirth Kshetra, an Hindu pilgrimage site. Visiting such a Shrine away from the crowd is pleasing for the heart. There is no other place like this anywhere in Brahamanda.
