  <h2>History of Karnataka</h2>
  <div class="ex4">
  <p>The recorded history of Karnataka goes back more than two millennia.
    Several great empires and dynasties have ruled over Karnataka and have contributed greatly to the history, culture and development of Karnataka
    <br></p>

  <p> The impact of kingdoms of Karnataka origin have been felt over other parts of India also. The Chindaka Nagas of central India, Gangas of Kalinga (Odisha),
     Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, Chalukyas of Vengi, Yadava Dynasty of Devagiri were all of Kannada origin who later took to encouraging local languages.</p>

  <p> Karnataka was the part of the Maurya Empire, the first Mauryan Emperor Chandragupta Maurya died in Shravanbelgola in Hassan District around 298 BCE where he spent last days of his life as Jain ascetic.
    Around 230 BCE, the Satavahana dynasty came to power and its rule lasted nearly four centuries, until the early 3rd century CE. The disintegration of the Satavahana dynasty led to the ascent of the earliest native
    kingdoms, the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi in modern Uttara Kannada district with Mayurasharma, a Brahmin native of Talagunda in modern Shivamogga district as the founding king, and the Western Ganga Dynasty in southern Karnataka, marking the birth of the region as an independent political entity. These were the first kingdoms to give administrative status to Kannada language as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription of 450, attributed to King Kakusthavarma of the Kadamba Dynasty. Also, recent discovery of a 5th-century copper coin in Banavasi, ancient capital of the Kadambas, with Kannada script inscription on it, further proves the usage of Kannada at an official level. </p>

  <p> They were followed by large imperial empires, the Badami Chalukyas, Rashtrakuta Dynasty and Western Chalukya Empire,
    who had their regal capitals in modern Karnataka region and patronised Kannada language and literature. Parts of Karnataka were conquered by the Chola Empire in the 11th century. </p>

  <p> Natives of the malnad Karnataka, the Hoysalas established the Hoysala Empire at the turn of the first millennium.
    Art and architecture flourished in the region during this time resulting in distinctive Kannada literary metres and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture. The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought large parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under their rule. </p>

  <p> In the early 14th century, the Vijayanagara Empire with its capital at Hosapattana (later to be called Vijayanagara) rose to successfully challenge the Muslim invasions into the South. This empire was established by Harihara I and Bukka Raya who many historians claim were commanders of the last Hoysala King Veera Ballala III and the empire prospered for over two centuries.
    The Bahmani sultans of Bidar were the main competitors to the Vijayanagara empire for hegemony over the Deccan and after their fall, the Bijapur Sultanate took their place in the dynastic struggle for control of the southern India. After the defeat and disintegration of the Vijayanagara Empire in battle at Talikota in 1565 to a confederacy of Sultanates, the Bijapur Sultanate rose as the main power in the Deccan before their defeat to the Mogul Empire in late 17th century. The Bahamani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this contribution. Parts of Karnataka were conquered by Marathas, earlier under Chhatrapati Shivaji and later on after the War of 27 years. </p>

  <p> The Wodeyars of Mysore, former vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire, leased the state from the Mughal king Aurangzeb
    in the 15th century. With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Haider Ali, the Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore Army, onloadedmetadata,
    assumed control over the region, until the rule of the kingdom was passed to Tipu Sultan, after Haider Ali's death. In attempting to contain European expansion in South India, Tipu Sultan,
    known as the Tiger of Mysore fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars, the last of which resulted in his death and the incorporation of Mysore into the British Raj. </p>

  <p> After Indian independence, the Wodeyar Maharaja acceded to India. In 1950,
    Mysore became an Indian state, and the former Maharaja became its rajpramukh, or governor,
    until 1975. The Ekikarana movement which started in the later half of the 20th century,
    culminated in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 which provided for parts of Coorg, Madras, Hyderabad, and Bombay states to be incorporated into the state of Mysore. Mysore state was renamed Karnataka in 1973.
    The state of Mysore was formed on November 1, 1956 and since then November 1 of every year is celebrated as Kannada Rajyotsava / Karnataka Rajyotsava. </p>

  <center> <h2>People and Culture</h2> </center>
  <p> Karnataka has hosted and continues to host a wide melting pot culture community. Along with the native Kannadigas, Kodavas, Tuluvas, Konkanis and several tribal sects have, across the centuries, lent colour and content to the vibrant culture the state calls its own. Karnataka is also home to the largest Tibetan settlement in South India. The recent past has seen a more inclusive populace with a large expatriate community making a beeline for the capital city of Bangalore. In addition Kannada, knowing Tulu, Hindi, English, Telugu or Tamil will safely get you by. Jainism, Hinduism and Islam are the predominantly practised religions. But in recent times, Sikhism, Christianity and Buddhism have also found their place and people. </p>

  <p> In dance, drama, theatre, crafts, art, poetry, architecture and scholarly pursuits, Karnataka brings with it a legacy of learning that predates the earliest dynasties. Perhaps the reason why the state, even to this date, is also home to some of the country's best academic institutions. </p>

  <center> <h2>Art Forms </h2> </center>
  <div class="ex4">
  <p> Karnataka as a patron of arts has nurtured it into the exemplar. Poets, musicians, dancers, thespians, story tellers, writers, artists have flourished in these parts and have contributed to the state's well-versed repertoire. India's most respected schools of music, Carnatic and Hindustani over the centuries, were perfected here, with the state bringing forth many greats - Gangubai Hangal, Puttaraj Gawai, Pt. Bhimsen Joshi and Purandara Dasa, among others. Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Kathak and Odissi have found their niche in the mainstream culture, and the state boasts some of the best schools in the country. Its characteristic penchant for vibrancy can be seen from the state's performing arts, which it has perfected into one of extravagance, drama and sheer delight.</p>

  <p> A slew of folk arts have their roots in ritualistic performances. While Yakshagana is undisputedly the poster-child of the art forms, its lesser known counterparts are as enthralling as they are many. We've listed them out for you here.  </p>

  <h4><b> Yakshagana </b></h4>
    <p> The “celestial song” or ‘Yakshagana’ is the most enchanting amalgamation of dance, music and literature. This traditional theatre form with a history of over 400 years is known for it extemporaneous dialogue delivery. Bhagavatha, the main storyteller accompanies a group of musicians - ‘chande’ and ‘mavdale’, as they weave mythological stories helped by hued costumes and dynamic dance forms. </p>

  <h4><b> Dollu Kunita </b></h4>
    <p>The Dollu Kunita is a powerful drum dance accompanied by acrobatic movements, synchronized group formations and the occasional screams. The shepherd community of Kurubas performs the dance to honour their deity, Beereshwara, a form of the Hindu god, Shiva. A major attraction for any religious festivals in villages, about a dozen artistes move with vigour to the rich vibrations of the Dollu or the drum. </p>

  <h4><b> Beesu Kamsale </b></h4>
  <p> Beesu Kamsale is a vigorous dance form closely associated with the rituals of Malle Mahadeswara worship and employs a great blend of aesthetic sublimity and martial agility. A cymbal-like disc, the ‘Kamsale’ is played in rhythm with the songs exalting the glory of the Lord Mahadeswara. </p>

  <h4><b> Somana Kunita </b></h4>
  <p> Somana Kunita is a religious, ritualistic dance performed by two or three artists with elaborate masks. Known as Somas, they were entrusted with the task of guarding the village deities and also worshipping them. The stories related to the birth of the Somas forms the crux of the performance. </p>

  <h4><b> Krishna Parijata </b></h4>
  <p> This traditional folk theater form revolves around Lord Krishna, and his fight with Indira over the Parijatha tree. Known for their frequent witticisms, they are mostly open-air performances. Simple plots and dialogues, spontaneity of the performers and impromptu improvisations make Krishna Parijata a great attraction to the audiences. </p>

  <h4><b> Chowdike Mela </b></h4>
  <p> The devotees of Yellama, the patron goddess of the rural folk of North Karnataka, perform Chowdike Mela. ‘Chowdike’, a unique stringed instrument, partners their mesmerizing praise of the Goddess. The singers usually dedicate their entire lives solely to singing the heavenly glory. </p>

  <h4><b> Goravara Kunita </b></h4>
    <p> This religious dance is performed by the devotees of Shiva, the Hindu God. Attired in fur cap made of bearskin and black and yellow clothing, they sway to the esoteric tunes of the flute and the ‘Damaruga’, a hand-held drum. Accompanying their trance-like movements, are songs handed down through generations, replete with deep mystic meanings. </p>

  <h4><b> Veeragaase </b></h4>
  <p> Veeragase gets its name from the Hindu legendary warrior, Veerabhadra, where dancers narrate the story of Daksha Yajna. Attired in colourful garb and traditional headgear, the dancers carry a wooden plaque of Veerabhadra in their left hand and a sword in their right. The dance sometimes involves a ritualistic piercing of a needle across the tongue. </p>

  <h4><b> Puja Kunita </b></h4>
  <p> Puja Kunita is the dance of worship performed to propitiate the Goddess Shakti. The dancer carries a five feet frame made out of bamboo called Puje, wrapped with beautiful saris and flowers, during the performance. Devoid of any stories, the dancers provide visual exclusivity by their acrobatic movements </p>

  <h4><b> Ummattaattu </b></h4>
  <p> Ummaattaattu is the traditional dance form of Coorg made famous by the beautiful Kodava women. Adorned in the traditional red brocade Sari, jewellery and red vermilion on the forehead, they dance in circles to the rhythms of hand-held brass cymbals. Accompanied by singing, the dance form – performed to appease Goddess Cauvery – is usually part of festivals, weddings, etc. </p>

  <h4><b> Jagghalige Kunita </b></h4>
  <p> A large percussion instrument made from the wheels of a bullock cart, wrapped with buffalo hides called ‘Jagghalige’ is largely used in this folk art. Usually involving about 15 people, the dancers march to the pulsating beat of the giant drums. Jagghalige Kunita is performed during festivals like Ugadi and Holi. </p>

  <h4><b> Suggi Kunita </b></h4>
  <p> A Harvest festival dance, Suggi Kunita is performed mostly by the farming community. Artists in beautiful costumes and wooden headgear adorned with carved birds and flowers dance to the tune of drums with sticks and peacock feathers. They enhance the dance sometimes, by their own signing. </p>

And then you have the ceremony to end all ceremonies - the once-in-twelve-years larger than life religious ceremony of the Maha Mastakabhisheka has a 52-foot statue of Bahubali is bathed in milk, sandalwood, vermillion, curd and what not.
